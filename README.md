# Protein Pow(d)er
Proteins are long chains of amino acids that play a crucial role in various processes in the human body. In this project, we work with three types of amino acids: hydrophobic amino acids (H), polar amino acids (P), and cysteine amino acids (C).

The stability of a protein is determined by certain interactions between the amino acids:
- Hydrophobic amino acids (H) form a stabilizing bond when they are adjacent to each other.
- Polar amino acids (P) avoid bonds and do not contribute to stability.
- Cysteine amino acids (C) form stabilizing bonds with other cysteines or with hydrophobic amino acids.

The goal is to fold the protein in such a way that the total stability, expressed in the lowest possible score, is maximized.
