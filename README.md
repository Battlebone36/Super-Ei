# Protein Pow(d)er
Proteins are long chains of amino acids that play a crucial role in various processes in the human body. In this project, we work with three types of amino acids: hydrophobic amino acids (H), polar amino acids (P), and cysteine amino acids (C).

The stability of a protein is determined by certain interactions between the amino acids:
- Hydrophobic amino acids (H) form a stabilizing bond when they are adjacent to each other.
- Polar amino acids (P) avoid bonds and do not contribute to stability.
- Cysteine amino acids (C) form stabilizing bonds with other cysteines or with hydrophobic amino acids.

The goal is to fold the protein in such a way that the total stability, expressed in the lowest possible score, is maximized.

# Installation and setup
## Requirements
### Library
The following command installs the necessary components for Tkinter on Python 3, enabling the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python on your system. 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
### Packages
The requirements.txt file contains all necessary packages to run the code successfully. These can be easily installed via pip using the following instruction:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage of the program
To run the program, use the following command:
```
python3 present.py
```
